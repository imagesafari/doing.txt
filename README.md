Alfred Extensions to track time or log work in TaskPaper format (specially
formatted plaintext)

This requires the Alfred PowerPack to work.

- Edit the script inside Alfred to change the path to your time tracking text
  file.

- .alfredextension file is for Alfred v1
- .alfredworkflow file is for Alfred v2 Beta

alfred_doing.sh is the script this extension is based upon. It may be useful
to add this functionality to the launcher of your choice.
